# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **Bimarsha Poudel**

**Sea Monster Crowfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ✅] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [✅ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ✅] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [✅ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* ✅ Used clean card-based layout for each game
* ✅ Console.log debugging for verifying filtered game lists
* ✅ Customized and structured template literals for readability
* ✅ Responsive image display with styling

## Notes
Some challenges I faced: 
* Making sure filtering did not stack multiple results (fixed with `deleteChildElements`)
* Matching exact class names and IDs to ensure DOM manipulation worked
* Understanding how to destructure and use spread operator to grab the top 2 funded games
